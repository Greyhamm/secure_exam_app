## Software Engineering Practices

This project incorporates a comprehensive suite of software engineering practices, demonstrating an understanding of the full software development lifecycle (SDLC):

### 1. **Project Initialization and Setup**
   - **Version Control**: Git for version tracking, with a repository on GitHub for easy collaboration and historical tracking.
   - **Documentation**: Initial project documentation is created in the `docs/` directory, including architecture, development guides, and user manuals.

### 2. **Software Design and Architecture**
   - **UML Diagrams**: Class diagrams, sequence diagrams, activity diagrams, and state diagrams to visualize the system architecture.
   - **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of client and server responsibilities, with structured folders for easier maintenance.

### 3. **Development Methodologies**
   - **Agile Principles**: The project is divided into well-defined phases, with iterative development and testing in each phase.
   - **Documentation-Driven Development**: Detailed guides outline each module's purpose and structure, ensuring code aligns with architectural decisions.

### 4. **Security Best Practices**
   - **Token-Based Authentication**: Secures endpoints and prevents unauthorized access.
   - **Data Protection**: Hashing for passwords and secure storage for sensitive data.
   - **Sandboxed Execution Environment**: Prevents any untrusted code from affecting system integrity during exams.

### 5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - **Unit Testing**: Focused tests on individual functions and modules.
   - **Integration Testing**: Tests to ensure modules work together smoothly, particularly for workflows like registration, login, and exam submission.
   - **Manual Testing**: User interface testing to validate usability and functionality.

### 6. **Deployment and Maintenance**
   - **Platform Compatibility**: Electron-based app for cross-platform deployment (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - **Continuous Documentation**: Documentation files such as `ROADMAP.md` and `TEST_PLAN.md` are maintained to track progress and document testing methods.
   - **Comprehensive User Manual**: Detailed instructions for end-users and administrators are included in the `user_guide/` directory.
